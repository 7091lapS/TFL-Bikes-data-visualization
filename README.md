# TFL-Bikes-data-visualization

A personal project to explore D3.js. My aim is to create some sort of dynamic data visualization of available Boris Bikes in the city of London over the course of a day. To get the data I am going to use the TFL Unified API.

## What I have done so far

* I took the sample data from all London's bike points
* I tried to display a map of London with geojson but could not correctly create paths
* I switched to topojson, managed to draw and style a map
* I am trying to display bike points with circles on the map. The circles are being created in the svg but in the wrong position.
